# ReadingList

## General programming books

- **The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master** by Andrew Hunt, David Thomas (https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X)<br>
Great book, served to me as a very nice summary of all things we should keep in mind as programmers. I can see myself reading some chapters again from time to time.

- [reading] **Working Effectively with Legacy Code** by Michael Feathers (https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=)

- [plan to read] **Coders at Work** by Peter Seibel (http://www.codersatwork.com/)

- [plan to read] **Art of UNIX programming** by Eric S. Raymond (http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/)

- [plan to read] **The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering** by Frederick P. Brooks Jr. (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13629.The_Mythical_Man_Month)

## Functional programming

- **Category theory for programmers** by Bartosz Milewski (https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf) <br>
Excellent book that gets you into CT pretty quickly. If this would be your first shot with CT, then you will
certainly find helpful Bartosz's talks on youtube, which are great way to deepen the gained knowledge. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LbkfSSR58)

- **Functional Programming in Scala** by Paul Chiusano and Runar Bjarnason (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala)<br>
Amazing book ! I couldn't imagine better introduction to FP. It is not about Scala at all, but about core principles of functional programming. Highly recommended. This book tought me about what functional programming is, what are the
basic constructs and then the more advance and abstract ones like monoids, monads, applicative functors etc.

- **FSharp for fun and profit** by Scott Wlaschin (https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/books/)<br>
Big honor to Scott, he has given us so much material to learn FP and F# from. This is just a must read for someone new to FP or F#. I learned so much from him such as proper domain modeling, composition or removing circular dependencies.

## .NET

- **Pro ASP.NET Core MVC** by Freeman Adam (https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484203972)<br>
Fine book, served me as a better documentation. It is very specific thought and I didn't find the examples very good in terms of general programming architecture, but sufficient for this specific enviroment.

- [plan to read] **CLR via C#** by Jeffrey Richter (https://www.amazon.com/CLR-via-4th-Developer-Reference/dp/0735667454v)

## PHP

- **Domain-Driven Design in PHP** by Carlos Buenosvinos, Christian Soronellas, and Keyvan Akbary (https://leanpub.com/ddd-in-php)<br>
Nice intro to DDD with PHP examples. Didn't read to the end, but found it good.

- **Build APIs You Won't Hate** by Phil Sturgeon (https://leanpub.com/build-apis-you-wont-hate)<br>
Very good introduction to building REST APIS, it teaches you how really should REST API look like and also why ! 
I learned how to make use of HTTP verbs, resources and HATEOS.

- **PHP the right way** by Josh Lockhart (http://www.phptherightway.com/)<br>
Good read for someone starting in PHP !

## Others

- [plan to read] **Recommender Systems Handbook** (http://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387858203)

## Papers

- **What we talk about when we talk about monads** by Tomas Petricek (http://programming-journal.org/2018/2/12/)
One of the best "tutorials on monads". Very well put.

- **Why most unit testing is waste** by James O Coplien (https://rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf)
Pretty good summary of advices when unit testing is not required and how to detect tests you can safely remove.
